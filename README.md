This project is an Accounting Ledger application with a Home screen, Ledger Menu screen, Reports Menu screen and allows you to search
by month-to-date, previous months, year-to-date, previous years and by vendor names. It also includes features that allow you to add deposits 
or make payments, logging and saving those transactions to a file for safe-keeping. 
Provided below are images of the screens and a glimpse of the features included 
as well as a portion of code from the method I believe is the most interesting:
